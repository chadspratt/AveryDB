dbfutil
=======

For joining dbf files and editing the fields. dbf files are totally uncompressed databases commonly used for gis data.

To use, you need to have Python 2.7 (2.6 will probably work, but it's untested) and PyGTK installed.
Use the PyGTK all-in-one installer from http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygtk/2.24/

A portable version is planned, but not a priority.

Run the file dbfutil.py

This uses the dbfpy library for reading and writing the files.
