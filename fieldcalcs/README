The files in this directory are treated as different libraries of functions for
the field calculator. Any .py file will be parsed and loaded, so it's important
to not have any syntax errors.

Within the program, functions are called by appending the filename to the
function name. For example, if addresses.py contained a function called
concataddr(num, stname, stdir, sttype)
then within the program you would put addresses.concataddr() and pass it either
constant values (101, 'Elm', 'N', 'St') or
references to values from an input file (!roads.hnum!, !roads.stname!...)

There are two special files:
default.py - functions in this file can be called without prefixing "default."
temporary.py - same as default.py except this file is cleared each time the
program starts

These files can all be edited directly or from within the program using the
calculator window.

If you include a docstring, like:
def somefunc(val1, val2):
    """Does something with some values"""
The string will be used for the tooltip when you hover over the function in the
calc window.

To clean up unwanted calc libraries you have to manually delete them from the
fieldcalcs directory. For one-off functions.

If you edit the files directly, use 4 spaces for indentation. The in-program
editor can use tabs, but it converts them to spaces when it writes the function
to a file.
