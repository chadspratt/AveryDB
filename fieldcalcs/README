The files in this directory are treated as different libraries of functions for
the field calculator. Any .py file will be parsed and loaded, so it's important
to not have any syntax errors.

Within the program, functions are called by appending the filename to the
function name. For example, if addresses.py contained a function called
concataddr(num, stname, stdir, sttype)
then within the program you would put addresses.concataddr() and pass it either
constant values (101, 'Elm', 'N', 'St') or
references to values from an input file (!roads.hnum!, !roads.stname!...)

There are two special files:
default.py - functions in this file can be called without prefixing "default."
temporary.py - same as default.py except this file is cleared each time the
program starts
